## 👋 About Me

Thank you for taking the time to visit my page. I am a driven **Computational Modeling & Data Analytics** student at **Virginia Tech**, with a minor in **Mathematics**.

My projects reflect a strong curiosity for solving complex problems through data, computation, and high-performance systems. I’ve worked on assignments and research involving **Python analytics**, **Java and C systems programming**, and **CUDA-based parallel computing**, each project showcasing my ability to design efficient algorithms, analyze data, and optimize performance.

My passion lies in creating meaningful impact—whether for organizations, stakeholders, or society at large—through thoughtful, scalable, and data-driven solutions.

I thrive on collaboration and innovation, and I'm eager to connect with like-minded professionals.  
**Let's work together to build solutions that drive security, efficiency, and progress. Let’s make an impact!**
