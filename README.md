# Angel Ochieng — Coding Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases my work across **Python**, **Java**, **C**, and **CUDA**, including class assignments, research projects, and parallel computing work.

The goal of this portfolio is to present clean, organized, and well documented projects that demonstrate my growth as a developer.
